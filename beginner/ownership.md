# Ownership

### Rules

- Each **value** in Rust has a **variable** thatâ€™s called its **owner**.
- There can only be **one owner at a time**.
- When the owner goes out of **scope**, the value will be dropped.

### Variable bindings

- **Have ownership** of what they're bound to.
- When a binding goes out of scope
